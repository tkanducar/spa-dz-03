Application in C++ including SFML for finding and drawing the shortest path from A to B using Dijkstra's algorithm.
The grid consists out of 20 rows and 40 columns. 
The application randomly creates 15% of obbstacles/walls, in the grid, with each start of the application.
Choose the start and end point with the left mouse button. 
You can choose any free (white color) cell as the start and end point.
After choosing the designated points, a path will be drawn with a delay of 100 miliseconds.
